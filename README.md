## Overview

## Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **Text Mining** using Python, with a focus on classifying SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). The dataset used is the **SMS Spam Collection**, which contains a set of labeled SMS messages.

The project walks through key steps of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text analytics, including data cleaning, tokenization, frequency analysis, and visualization using word clouds. It serves as an introduction to working with real-world text datasets in Python.

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords, etc.)
- Tokenization and word frequency distribution
- Word cloud generation
- Exploratory analysis of textual data
- Visualization with Matplotlib and WordCloud

## Technologies Used

- Python üêç
- Jupyter Notebook üìì
- `nltk` for natural language processing
- `matplotlib` and `wordcloud` for visualizations
